## üéØ PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY

DevOps and Cloud Engineer with a strong foundation in automation, infrastructure-as-code, and platform engineering. I design and operate secure, scalable CI/CD platforms using Terraform, Kubernetes, and GitHub Actions, with Python at the core for tooling, integrations, and automation. Experienced across AWS and Azure, I focus on developer productivity, cloud cost efficiency, and security-by-design (DevSecOps) practices.

Currently seeking DevOps/Cloud roles: Platform Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Cloud Engineer, or Cloud Security‚Äìfocused DevOps.

## üöÄ FEATURED PROJECTS 

### 1) Terraform Cloud/Platform Automation
- Stack: Terraform, Terragrunt, AWS (VPC, EKS, RDS, IAM, S3), GitHub Actions, OIDC
- Highlights:
  - Built reusable Terraform modules for VPC, EKS, RDS, and IAM with least-privilege.
  - Implemented GitHub OIDC to enable keyless deploys to AWS, removing long-lived secrets.
  - Multi-env (dev/stage/prod) via Terragrunt with drift detection and plan/apply gates.
  - Added policy-as-code checks (OPA/Conftest) and security scanning (tfsec, Trivy) in CI.
- Outcomes: Repeatable environment provisioning, faster onboarding, and improved security posture.

### 2) Kubernetes Platform Engineering 
- Stack: Kubernetes (EKS/AKS), Helm, ArgoCD, NGINX Ingress, Cert-Manager, Prometheus/Grafana
- Highlights:
  - Designed a GitOps workflow: app and infra Helm charts deployed via ArgoCD.
  - Implemented autoscaling (HPA), canary rollouts, and blue/green strategies with health checks.
  - Centralized logging/metrics with EFK/Loki and actionable alerts via Alertmanager.
  - Secured cluster with RBAC, network policies, and image/signature scanning policies.
- Outcomes: Reliable release cadence, faster recovery, and strong observability.

### 3) "ABC App" ‚Äî Sample Microservices App (placeholder)
- Stack: Python (FastAPI), Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions
- Highlights:
  - Monorepo with services for API, auth, and worker; containerized with Docker.
  - CI/CD pipelines: build, test, SBOM, image scan, and Helm-based deploy to EKS.
  - Feature flags and environment-specific configuration via Helm values.
- Note: This is a placeholder entry until the repository is public. Ask for a demo.

### 4) Python Automation Toolkit for Cloud Ops
- Stack: Python, Boto3/Azure SDK, Click/Typer, GitHub Actions, Make
- Highlights: CLI tools for rotating credentials, cleaning unused resources, tagging policies, and cost reports. Packaged and published internally; tested with pytest and tox.
